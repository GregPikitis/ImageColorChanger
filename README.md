# ImageColorChanger
Changes all of the colors in a select image to one chosen hex code.
I use this to change icon colors with transparent backgrounds. Works on my machine.

### Dependancies:
- [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- Understanding that this is basically just a script to run ImageMagick commands
